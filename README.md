Scalable Augmented Reality prototype with holo projections on miniature real-world scene. Unlike through-the screen augmented reality solutions, holo projections on real world create rich and immersive experience. Also, the solutions can be scaled to a large size settings. Examples include observation decks, zoos, museums, store-fronts, etc.

Technologies used:
- custom video projections installation - for holographic image projections
- Leap Motion - for over the air gestures detection and interface control
- d3.js - for data visualization
- Lego - for simulating miniature city environment
